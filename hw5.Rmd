## Question 1

The commit history has three commits. One with the initial commit of the blank files. One with updated llr_functions.R and test_llr.R files. One with an updated benchmark_llr.R file. We have one branch called master that is pointing to the last commit. The HEAD is pointing to master.

## Question 2 (the first time)

After creating a new branch, HEAD is pointing to speed-test-1. After making changes, the master will point to the older commit, while speed-test-1 will point to the new commit that contains our new changes. 

## Question 2 (the second time)

We used apply. Since only the diagonal of Wz has numbers, this is equalivalent to each element of a Wz vector (diagonal values of original Wz) being multiplied by each row of X and y. 

## Question 3

The new version is much fast. The speed-test-1 version cut the mean time in half.
